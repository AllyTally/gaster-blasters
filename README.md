# gaster-blasters
please, not another sans fight...



ok so this ones actually super straight forward

throw `require "Libraries/gaster_blasters"` at the top of your wave script

to create a gaster blaster, use blaster.New

`blaster.New(start_x,start_y,goto_x,goto_y,rotation,startrotation=0)`

start_x and start_y are where the gaster blaster spawns, this is normally off screen

goto_x and goto_y are where the gaster blaster moves to, this is normally on screen

rotation is where the gaster blaster turns to face

startrotation is what the gaster blaster starts out as, this is 0 by default as thats what undertale does im pretty sure
